# Brute Force Attack Simulation with John the Ripper

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how attackers exploit weak passwords using a brute-force attack. Using **John the Ripper** on **Kali Linux**, a weak SHA-512 hashed password was successfully cracked, highlighting the importance of strong password policies.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Environment
- **Kali Linux**
- **John the Ripper (Jumbo Version)**
- **RockYou Wordlist** (/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt)

---

## 📝 Steps Performed

### 1. Generated a Test Hash (SHA-512)

### 2. Saved Hash in Correct Format

### 3. Ran John the Ripper

### 4. Output (Password Cracked)

---

## 🔍 Key Takeaways
- Weak passwords can be cracked in seconds using common wordlists.
- Always enforce **strong password policies** and use **multi-factor authentication**.

---

## ✅ Recommendations
✔ Use complex passwords (12+ characters, mix of letters, numbers, symbols).  
✔ Avoid using passwords from common wordlists (like RockYou).  
✔ Implement account lockout policies and MFA.
